Find SQL Services and Accounts

By Michael D'Spain , 2015/12/18

If you need to find the service account for SQL and the SQL Agent across the enterprise, this script will do the trick.   It does require a list of Servers in which to iterate through.   I have a repository database of servers and used that as my source list of servers but if you have that list in a text file use the get-content cmdlet to populate the Instance variable   

Get-WmiObject win32_service will provide the necessary data for the services in question.   Startname is the name of the Service Account. 

After the out-file cmdlet, enter a filepath and name of the file.  This script creates a pipe delimited list.   I could have used export-csv but this worked just fine.  

Enjoy!!

##initialize variable 
$Instance = $()
##list of serverrs to iterate through. this could be a tex file of servers, example get-content c:\listofservers.txt

$Instance = invoke-sqlcmd -ServerInstance <SQL Server Envirorment Repository> -Database <Repo DB> -query "<Select Servername from Server Repository>" -SuppressProviderContextWarning 
##counter
$i =1
$count = $Instance.count
##header for text file.  guess i could have done export-csv but anyway this works
"Server"+"|"+"SQL Service"+"|"+"SQL Service Account"+"|"+"SQL Agent"+"|"+"SQL Agent Account" | out-file C:\Users\mdspain\Desktop\Services5.txt


foreach($Server in $Instance){
##make sure you have a object that can be used as a string and not a datarow object
$computer = $($Server.Servername)


## find sql server services and service accounts 
$Service = Get-WmiObject win32_service -ComputerName $computer  | where {$_.Name -eq 'MSSQLServer' -or $_.Name -eq 'SQLSERVERAGENT' } 


##write counter to screen(I hate looking at a blank screen)
write-host $i"..of.."$count


##create text file and append each iteration to that file 
 $computer +"|"+$($Service[0].name) +"|" +$($Service[0].startname) +"|"+$($Service[1].name)+ "|"+$($Service[1].startname ) |  out-file C:\<filepath\name of file.txt> -Append


$i++
}
